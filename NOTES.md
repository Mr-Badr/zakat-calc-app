Step 1: Expand and Deepen Zakat Type Pages
Ensure each /zakat/[type] page has:
Intro: What is this zakat, why is it important?
Conditions: Who must pay, when, and why?
How to Calculate: Simple explanation, with a real-world example.
Madhhab Notes: Brief, clear differences (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi’i, Hanbali).
FAQ: 5–10 common, real questions per type, with clear, referenced answers.
Sources: Inline links/footnotes to digital fatwa/fiqh sources.
Internal Links: To other zakat types, articles, and calculator.
Call-to-Action: “Start Your Calculation Now” button.

Step 2: Add/Expand Articles (Blog)
Create a rich /articles section:
Write or curate articles on zakat, Islamic finance, charity, and related topics.
Each article should have:
date, tags, summary, and full content.
Internal links to zakat types, FAQs, and calculator.
Sources and further reading links.
FAQ/HowTo schema for SEO.

Step 3: Polish FAQ Page
Expand /faq with:
General zakat questions.
Category-specific FAQs (money, gold, business, etc.).
Each answer should be clear, referenced, and easy to understand.

Step 4: Sources & Scholar Review
Expand /sources to:
List all digital and classical sources (Qur’an, hadith, fiqh books, fatwa sites).
Add links to IslamQA, Dar al-Ifta, etc.
Optionally, add a “Reviewed by Scholars” section (even if just “pending” for now).

Step 5: Internal Linking & Navigation
Ensure every page has:
Links to related zakat types, articles, FAQs, and calculator.
“See also” or “Related topics” sections.

Step 6: Multilingual Content
Make sure all new/expanded content is available in Arabic, English, and French.
Use clear, accessible language in all translations.
